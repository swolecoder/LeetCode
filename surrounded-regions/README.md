<h2>130. Surrounded Regions</h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given a 2D board containing <code>'X'</code> and <code>'O'</code> (<strong>the letter O</strong>), capture all regions surrounded by <code>'X'</code>.</p>

<p>A region is captured by flipping all <code>'O'</code>s into <code>'X'</code>s in that surrounded region.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
</pre>

<p>After running your function, the board should be:</p>

<pre>X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
</pre>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<p>Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any <code>'O'</code>&nbsp;on the border of the board are not flipped to <code>'X'</code>. Any <code>'O'</code>&nbsp;that is not on the border and it is not connected to an <code>'O'</code>&nbsp;on the border will be flipped to <code>'X'</code>. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.</p>
